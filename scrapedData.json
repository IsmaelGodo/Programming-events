These are designed to share particular security expertise and solutions with top security decision-makers. Their belief is that customized round-table meetings are the most efficient and effective method available. With the Chatham House Rule in place, these high-­value, closed-­door events foster good networking among important stakeholders, allowing invited guests to obtain deep insights into current areas of concern and potential solutions to address those areas.\n\nAs a delegate, you will be presented with cutting-edge security solutions, case studies, and best practices from hand-picked specialists, as well as the opportunity to expand your peer-to-peer network. Their current portfolio is focused on data security, data protection, regulatory compliance, fraud, payment risk, and the PCI DSS.\n\nThey now offer events centered on the following security topics:\n\ne-Crime & Cybersecurity\nPCI DSS\nSecuring Financial Services\nSecuring the Law Firm\nSecuring Online Gaming\n\ne-Crime & Cybersecurity Congress in Abu Dhabi 2022\n\nThey all require cybersecurity, which will be discussed at the 12th e-Crime & Cybersecurity Congress in Abu Dhabi. Join them for their in-depth technical seminars and real-world case studies from the security and privacy teams of some of the most respected businesses in the world.\n\nFrom cyberwar to cybercrime:\n\nThe (in)security landscape has changed as a result of blurred borders between cyberspies, cybercriminals, and cybercrimes. Nation-state exploits are now readily accessible.\nHow can the various branches of government more effectively collaborate with end users, private sector solution providers, and non-nation-state adversaries to create security that can withstand them?\n\ne-Crime & Cybersecurity Congress Switzerland 2022\n\nWe all require a new type of security, which will be discussed at the first e-Crime & Cybersecurity Congress Switzerland. Join us for our in-depth technical seminars and real-world case studies from the security and privacy teams of some of the most respected businesses in the world.\n\nCan one get zero trust?\n\nThe acronyms Zero Trust/ZTNA/SASE promise solutions to the major issues CISOs are now dealing with.\nHow realistic are they, though? Do they consider legacy technology that is already in use and the day-to-day operations of actual businesses?\nCan you describe how a practical implementation operates?\n\ne-Crime & Cybersecurity Mid-Year Summit 2022\n\nWe all require a new type of security, which will be discussed at the 14th e-Crime & Cybersecurity Mid-Year Summit. Join us for our in-depth technical seminars and real-world case studies from the security and privacy teams of some of the most respected businesses in the world.\n\nHackers will continue to elude antiquated control frameworks unless cybersecurity is really regarded as risk management and not a whack-a-mole IT problem.\nCISOs, boards, and solution suppliers are all responsible for a portion of this.\nBanks have carried it out. When will the company as a whole catch up?\n\nAnnual e-Crime & Cybersecurity Congress Spain 2022\n\nAround 40 day-long events are offered annually by AKJ Associates to a variety of regional and industry-specific markets.\n\nLondon, Abu Dhabi, Amsterdam, Dubai, Frankfurt, Madrid, Munich, Paris, and Stockholm are among the locations. 5,529 senior decision-makers came to our events last year.\n\nAs a delegate, you will expand your peer-to-peer network while learning about cutting-edge security solutions, case studies, and best practices from hand-picked experts. The PCI DSS, fraud, regulatory compliance, data protection, and information security are the main topics of our present offering.\n\nThe following security-related events are being offered by AKJ Associates at the moment:\n\ne-Crime & Cybersecurity\nPCI DSS\nSecuring Financial Services\nSecuring the Law Firm\nSecuring Online Gaming\n\n24th PCI London 2023\n\nPCI DSS 4.0 is more than just an update to a standard dedicated to protecting a few digits of a PAN. It places new emphasis on risk analysis and organizational governance; it has significant implications for client-side security; and it includes brand new requirements for how businesses identify, inventory, and manage scripts that collect payment information in web browsers.\n\nCompliance activities are no longer restricted to once a year but are now required on a continuous basis. Additionally, organizations will be required to produce more security documentation. In addition, regular QSA assessments will increase the scrutiny placed on PCI 4.0 activities.\n\nRequirement 6.4.1 states that new threats and vulnerabilities are addressed on an ongoing basis for public-facing web applications and that these applications are protected from known attacks.\n\nRequirement 6.4.3 states, among other things, that an inventory of scripts must be kept, with written justification for why each script is required, and that a method must be put in place to ensure the integrity of each script.\n\nRequirement 12 broadens the scope of compliance and makes compliance continuous, rather than just a single point in time. It also requires merchants and service providers to conduct annual reviews of hardware and software technologies in use, as well as plans for updating outdated technologies.\n\nThese examples from the new standard demonstrate that, if followed, PCI DSS 4.0 provides far more than simple compliance on a limited set of payment data. It lays the groundwork for securing a modern business in an e-commerce-driven, digital world.\n\nFirms, however, will need to change their mindset in order to achieve compliance. The customized approach, enhanced validation methods and procedures, and some other elements of the new standard are novel, and some are incompatible with current QSA validation methods.\n\nJoin other professionals in London on January 25th to learn from a combination of technical presentations, case studies, and interactive panels, as well as to reconnect with old friends and colleagues and make new contacts. And then join us for a drink.\n\nThis will be our first face-to-face event since the pandemic, and we are thrilled to be launching it at a time when the Standard has been renewed, and possibly transformed, into a security and privacy template for the modern, digitally-enabled business.\n\ne-Crime & Cybersecurity Congress UK 2023\n\nAt this year’s e-Crime & Cybersecurity Conference, we will be discussing the necessity of a new type of security for all of us. Participate in the security and privacy teams of some of the most well-known and respected brands in the world as they present real-life case studies and in-depth technical workshops.\n\nAround 40 one-day events are provided by AKJ Associates on an annual basis, catering to a variety of local and industry-specific vertical markets.\n\nThe cities of London, Abu Dhabi, Amsterdam, Dubai, Frankfurt, Madrid, Munich, Paris, and Stockholm are among those that are represented. During the prior year, there were 5,529 senior-level decision-makers present at their events.\n\nWhen expanding your peer-to-peer network as a delegate, you will receive cutting-edge security solutions, case studies, and best practices from professionals who have been carefully selected. Information security, data protection, regulatory compliance, fraud, payments risk, and the PCI Data Security Standard are currently the primary focuses of their business.\n\nAt this time, they provide events that are centered on topics related to the following types of security:\n\ne-Crime & Cybersecurity\nPCI DSS\nSecuring Financial Services\nSecuring the Law Firm\nSecuring Online Gaming\n\nProud to recommend one of our partners: The Australian Cyber Conference in Melbourne!\n\n Twitter\n LinkedIn\n\nFollow us on Twitter for alerts, or join our LinkedIn with over 6K members!",

Unfortunately, the advancement of cyber-security paradigms has not proceeded at the same rate, creating a significant vacuum in available protections for the new varieties of distributed and heterogeneous systems against a changing cyber-threat scenario.\n\nAntivirus software, intrusion prevention systems, and firewalls, which enterprises have long used to safeguard their networks, are no longer able to offer adequate security guarantees against the rapidly escalating sophistication of advanced persistent threats and multi-vector attacks. It is critically necessary to increase the spatial and temporal correlation of (pretending to be) independent events and logs, as well as the level of coordination between various security systems, due to the complexity of cyberattacks.\n\nThis session seeks to bring together cutting-edge methods for giving businesses the necessary situational awareness regarding cyber security risks so they can promptly identify and successfully counteract complex cyberattacks.\n\nProud to recommend one of our partners: The Australian Cyber Conference in Melbourne!\n\n Twitter\n LinkedIn\n\nFollow us on Twitter for alerts, or join our LinkedIn with over 6K members!",

Currently, those devices are not very secure for a variety of reasons. For starters, manufacturers do not prioritize security, producing goods that are open to attacks, leaving users with security concerns that are unlikely to be rectified. Second, many IoT devices lack the computer ability to run an antivirus or do not allow it to be installed.\n\nFinally, the heterogeneity of the IoT in terms of apps, hardware, and software broadens the attack surface while increasing the difficulty of adopting all-encompassing security solutions. Despite the security provided by IoT enabling technologies (e.g., communication protocols) or intrusion prevention systems (e.g., network firewalls), attackers continue to develop ways to compromise devices or their communication.\n\nUnlike laptop and desktop computers, which have periodic on-off cycles, many IoT devices, such as webcams and wireless routers, work unsupervised 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nAs a result, IoT devices are particularly vulnerable to various assaults, such as those aimed at recruiting devices for botnets. As a result, IoT networks are not only harmful for themselves but also for remote systems that are targets of assaults launched by infected IoT devices. Furthermore, IoT-based systems that handle sensitive data (for example, healthcare IS) must respond quickly to malicious activity in order to prevent private data from exiting the network.\n\nAs a result, IoT networks must have some form of security mechanism, such as intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, attack reaction systems, proactive defense mechanisms, and so on.\n\nThe main topics include but are not limited to:\n\nIntrusion Detection Systems\nMalware/Botnet detection\nSecurity for VANETS/MANETS\nSecurity for IoT-based systems (industrial control, healthcare monitoring, Cyber Physical Systems, domotic)\nSecurity for cloud-based IoT applications\nSecurity at the edge/fog\nAttack detection and countermeasures\nGame theory for the IoT security\nSecurity resources placement strategies\nSecurity for software defined IoT networks\nSecurity for narrowband IoT networks\nSecurity for SCADA-based systems\nIoT firmware analysis\nAutomatic exploit generation for IoT devices\nSide channel attacks for IoT devices\nCryptography for IoT\nTamperproofing techniques for IoT\n\nProud to recommend one of our partners: The Australian Cyber Conference in Melbourne!\n\n Twitter\n LinkedIn\n\nFollow us on Twitter for alerts, or join our LinkedIn with over 6K members!",
